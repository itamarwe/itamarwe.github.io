I specialize in consulting for AI, machine learning, and big data, leveraging advanced techniques in data science to build intelligent systems that drive business growth. With extensive experience in designing and implementing high-scale distributed systems, I provide solutions that are both scalable and efficient, suitable for complex environments.

My expertise spans across cloud architecture, modern application development frameworks like Node.js and Angular, and creating secure and resilient platforms for diverse use cases. I have a deep understanding of blockchain technology and virtual currencies, developing both secure messaging systems and decentralized applications.

I work with organizations to harness the power of AI and distributed systems to solve challenging problems, optimize processes, and innovate at scale.
