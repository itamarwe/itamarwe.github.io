I offer expert consulting in AI and machine learning, specializing in advanced techniques such as PyTorch, convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning, diffusion networks, and autoencoders. My work focuses on developing and deploying intelligent systems that provide measurable business impact, using cutting-edge methodologies to solve complex problems.

I have extensive experience in building and optimizing high-scale distributed systems using technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, PySpark, Databricks, Snowflake, AWS Redshift, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I am proficient in designing cloud-native architectures and scalable data pipelines on platforms such as AWS (including EMR), GCP, and Azure, ensuring high performance, reliability, and security for data-intensive applications.

Additionally, I specialize in modern application development frameworks such as Node.js and Angular, and I have a deep understanding of blockchain technologies and virtual currencies. My expertise includes creating secure messaging systems, decentralized applications, and other innovative solutions in the space of cybersecurity and distributed ledger technologies.

I partner with organizations to leverage the power of AI, machine learning, and distributed systems to drive innovation, optimize operations, and scale effectively in today's fast-paced digital landscape.
