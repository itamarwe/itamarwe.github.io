## Background:

I developed my first computer program in 1992 at the age of 10 â€” an analog clock created using [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). Throughout high school, I pursued a variety of creative projects, including music production, 3D modeling, and animation rendering. I operated multiple [BBSs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system), developed management tools, and experimented with cybersecurity. I also built and piloted radio-controlled model airplanes and later became an instructor. Additionally, I created a [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) memorization tool in [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) to help me prepare for the SATs, and developed a natural language processing tool capable of constructing a semantic network and responding to queries in natural language.

Since those early years, I have continued to build upon my diverse interests and skills. I earned a B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics from Hebrew University and an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Tel Aviv University, combining my passion for technology and problem-solving with a strong academic foundation. Professionally, I have developed complex systems in fields ranging from blockchain technology and secure communications to online marketplaces and autonomous navigation systems.

My career has been driven by a commitment to innovation and excellence, whether designing algorithms for real-time data visualization or developing scalable APIs for SMS marketing campaigns. I have had the privilege of working with a wide range of clients and industries, helping them achieve their goals through tailored software solutions and strategic technology consulting.

## Education:

- B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics - Hebrew University
- M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering - Tel Aviv University

## Projects:

### Blockchain Customization
Customized a proof-of-stake blockchain to meet client-specific requirements. This involved guiding multiple development teams, inexperienced in cryptocurrency, through the integration process. The new cryptocurrency successfully passed several rigorous security and functionality audits.

### Cryptocurrency Exchange
Developed a cryptocurrency exchange platform enabling secure, automated trading between a custom cryptocurrency and Bitcoin.

### Ethereum Token
Created an Ethereum token tailored to the client's specifications and designed a smart contract for a trustless exchange of the token.

### Double-Ratchet Secure Messaging System
Defined the requirements for a secure messaging system, researched potential solutions, and selected, adapted, and integrated a double-ratchet messaging protocol into the client's application.

### Accurate Autonomous Landing System for [Multicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multirotor)
Developed a computer vision-based algorithm for accurately identifying a unique pattern on a ground base station, essential for autonomous multicopter landing. The algorithm was designed to be highly accurate, computationally efficient, real-time, and height-invariant. Implemented using OpenCV on an embedded Linux board, it enabled precise positional and orientational landing.

### Online Marketplace
Developed a comprehensive two-sided online marketplace platform. Sellers could create profiles and offer services, while buyers could search, contact, book, and pay online, as well as leave reviews. The system included an admin interface for approving sellers, monitoring transactions, handling disputes, and managing payouts. The platform was built using Node.js, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Angular, with integration for email, SMS, and telephony services, and was optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

### SMS Sending API
Developed a scalable SMS sending platform with a user-friendly API for a [Kannel](http://www.kannel.org/) server. The platform featured self-service capabilities, allowing users to subscribe, input payment details, and manage SMS campaigns. It also included an admin interface for monitoring system health and activity. Built using Node.js, MongoDB, and Angular.js, the platform supported millions of SMS messages for various marketing campaigns.

### Angular.js Course
Designed and instructed a comprehensive one-week Angular.js course, delivered multiple times to developers at [Pictet Private Bank](https://www.group.pictet/) and other front-end developers in Geneva, Switzerland.

### Flash-Card Based Spaced Repetition Tool for Memorization
Developed a user-friendly Facebook app to create and practice flashcards using the [spaced repetition](https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) algorithm to optimize learning.

### Real-Time Apache Kafka Visualization
Created a tool to visualize real-time, high-throughput data streams, aggregate statistics, and provide real-time search capabilities, using Node.js, Angular.js, Socket.io, and Apache Kafka.
